"No Bearing" is a short work inspired by and derived entirely from the sounds
produced by an aluminum yoyo. The piece's spectral layout, structure, and use of
modulation are all intended to reflect the sonic qualities of a spinning
ball-bearing yoyo; a droning, consistent low register accompanied by piercing,
resonant upper harmonics. Structurally, 'No Bearing' has two main sections: an
initial, low velocity throw (the first 35 seconds), followed by a more confident
one. Two important aspects of the composition are its flurries of high-pitched
klangs (sampled and re-pitched by modulating playback speed with a random number
generator) and frequent modulations that cross over and under the 20Hz threshold
(through the use of LFOs and ring modulation).
