“Rearranged” is a short octophonic work made from instrumental samples and
conrete sounds. The piece uses granular synthesis to turn sampled instruments
into drones, which are then layered, modulated, and panned in 2D in order to
create varied textures and gestures. Listen for harmonic content underneath
layers of noise.
