For this project, I attempted to recreate the foley used in the intro to
*Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit*. The scene depicts an
elaborate Rube Goldberg machine, which I tried to bring to life through sound
design. Working on this project taught me a great deal about sound design and
foley, particularly the incorporation of foley into a larger project. Mixing
turned out to be the most labor-intensive part of the project, as I hoped to
effectively convey the scene's spatial depth in stereo.
