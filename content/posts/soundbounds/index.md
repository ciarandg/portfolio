SoundBounds is a first-of-its-kind soundtracking mod for Minecraft,
allowing players to define sophisticated region-based soundtracks for
their worlds. Like Minecraft itself, SoundBounds uses OpenAL (through
LWJGL) for its sound engine, allowing for virtually seamless in-game
integration and smooth, artifact-free fades and effects. Additionally,
it offers a variety of community-focused features such as artist promo
links (accessible through its now-playing command), definable groups and
featured artists!
