In Retrospect is a short electroacoustic work created for manipulation of
concrete sounds, sample MIDI instruments, and my own voice. I used Kontakt to
reorchestrate Debussy's Romance, adding strings, flute, and clarinet, and then
manipulated the manipulated the audio from that arrangement to create drones and
atmospheric textures, which I combined with concrete noises and a recording of
myself reciting the lyrics to the Debussy piece. My goal was to convey the
narrator of the poem's point of view, using soft orchestral timbres alongisde
those dissonant concrete sounds to mimick the clash between his interepretation
of the past, and the obsessive, slightly spiteful way that he uses it to debase
and blame his love interest.
