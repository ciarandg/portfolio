Parnassus is a tool for validating notated music according to the rules
stated in Johann Joseph Fux's *Gradus ad Parnassum*, a classic
educational text on contrapuntal harmony. *Gradus ad Parnassum* provides
a set of compositional approaches (referred to as "species"), which grow
progressively more complex and are governed by strict rulesets.

Parnassus was developed for UBC's basic OOP course, CPSC 210, to
demonstrate my understanding of Java idioms and the Swing toolkit.
It currently only validates first-species compositions.
