I'm a DevOps engineer based in Edmonton, Alberta. I enjoy building systems, functional programming, NixOS, and Kubernetes. When I've got time, you can find me working on my homelab.

Before I entered the industry, I studied music technology, where Iâ€™ve worked with digital signal processing in JUCE and Max/MSP, explored livestreaming setups, and delved into interactive music-making and sound design.

I also like cooking, bartending, and swimming :)
