## About
<!-- ![headshot](headshot.jpg) -->
I'm a programmer and musician currently based in Edmonton, Alberta. I have a broad background working with audio, from DSP in JUCE and Max/MSP to livestreaming, interactive music-making, foley, and sound design. In my free time, I'm an avid Linux tinkerer, French horn player, and long-distance swimmer.

Having recently graduated from the University of British Columbia (BMUS 2017-2021, minor in Applied Music Technology), I'm currently focused on honing my software engineering abilities. I'm extremely interested in game audio implementation, and am currently working on major projects in OpenAL, Raylib, and JUCE that explore the subject. 

Since late 2019, I've worked extensively with livestreaming and A/V, first as a Webcast Assistant for [UBC Ensembles](http://vimeo.com/ubcmusic) (Symphony Orchestra, Symphonic Wind Ensemble, and Choirs), and later helping my mother\'s [business](http://getcooking.ca/) transition from hosting in-person events to a fully online, livestreamed model during COVID. Working with the UBC Ensembles (both as an A/V tech and as a performer) has taught me a great deal, and I'm proud to have worked closely with such an experienced group of musicians, camera operators, and audio engineers. Likewise, in helping to reinvent my family business during a crisis, I have built a full-scale livestreaming setup from scratch, trained staff to manage streams, and helped write provincial grant applications that funded the process.
