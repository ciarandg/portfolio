## About
<!-- ![headshot]({{< assetUrl src="headshot.jpg" >}}) -->
I'm a DevOps engineer based in Edmonton, Alberta, with a passion for functional programming, declarative infrastructure management, and tools like NixOS and Kubernetes.

My background extends beyond DevOps into the world of audio and music technology, where Iâ€™ve worked with digital signal processing in JUCE and Max/MSP, explored livestreaming setups, and delved into interactive music-making and sound design.

I also like cooking, bartending, and swimming :)
