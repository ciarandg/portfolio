## About
<!-- ![headshot](headshot.jpg) -->
I'm an automation developer and musician currently based in Edmonton,
Alberta. I have a broad background working with audio, from DSP in JUCE
and Max/MSP to livestreaming, interactive music-making, and sound design.
In my free time, I'm an avid Linux tinkerer, French horn player, and
long-distance swimmer.

Since graduating from the University of British Columbia (BMUS
2017-2021, minor in Applied Music Technology), I have worked to hone my
abilities as a developer. In particular, I have a strong interest in
NixOS, functional programming, DevOps and GitOps.
